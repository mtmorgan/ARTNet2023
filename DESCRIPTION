Description: This workshop provides an introduction to using R and
    Bioconductor to explore single-cell gene expression data. We focus
    on ‘downstream’ analysis, for example after a bioinformatics core
    has performed initial cell type classification, differential gene
    expression, etc. Example tasks we will cover include data input of
    ‘csv’ and other files, visualization (e.g., UMAPs), and essential
    statistical analysis (e.g., simple survivorship). Participants
    with some exposure to R and RStudio will be well-positioned to
    benefit from this workshop.
