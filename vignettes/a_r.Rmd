# Introduction

This article introduces _R_ as an essential tool in exploratory
analysis of bioinformatic data. No previous experience with _R_ is
required. We start with a very short introduction to _R_, mentioning
vectors, functions, and the `data.frame` for representing tabular
data. We introduces 'packages' that extend base _R_ functionality, and
explore some essential data management tasks, reading a 'CSV'
(comma-separated value) file, and visualizing data. We conclude in a
short work-flow to read in data and perform a Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis, including generating a graphical summary.

# Essential _R_

A simple calculator

```{r}
1 + 1
```

'Vectors' as building blocks

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c("January", "February", "March")
c(TRUE, FALSE)
```

Variables, missing values and 'factors'

```{r}
age <- c(27, NA, 32, 29)
gender <- factor(
    c("Female", "Male", "Non-binary", NA),
    levels = c("Female", "Male", "Non-binary")
)
```

Data structures to coordinate related vectors -- the `data.frame`

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
    age = c(27, NA, 32, 29),
    gender = gender
)
df
```

Key opererations on `data.frame`

- `df[1:3, c("gender", "age")]` -- subset on rows and columns
- `df[["age"]]`, `df$age` -- select columns

Functions

```{r}
rnorm(5)        # 5 random normal deviates
x <- rnorm(100) # 100 random normal deviates
hist(x)         # histogram, approximately normal
plot(density(x)) # a little more sophisticated?
```

'Vectorized' operations, e.g., element-wise addition without an
explicit 'for' loop


```{r}
y <- x + rnorm(100)
plot(y ~ x)
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
fit         # an R 'object' containing information about the
            # regression of y on x
abline(fit) # plot points and fitted regression line
anova(fit)  # statistical summary of linear regression
```

Write your own functions

```{r}
hello <- function(who) {
    paste("hello", who, "with", nchar(who), "letters in your name")
}
hello("Martin")
```

Iterate, usually with `lapply()` although `for()` is
available

```{r}
names <- c("Martin", "Thomas")
lapply(names, hello)
```

# Packages

Extend functionality of base _R_. Can be part of the 'base' distribution...

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
    x = rnorm(100),
    y = x + rnorm(100)
)
```

... or a package contributed by users to the Comprehensive R Archive
Network ([CRAN][]), or to [Bioconductor][] or other repositories. A
particularly common suite of packages is the 'tidyverse'.  To use the
[dplyr][] contributed CRAN package, load the package

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

A dplyr 'tibble' is like a 'data.frame', but more user-friendly

```{r}
tbl <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(100),
    y = x + rnorm(100)
)

tbl # e.g., only displays the first 10 rows
```

The tidyverse makes use of 'pipes' `|>` (the older syntax is `%>%`). A
pipe takes the left-hand side and pass through to the right-hand
side. Key [dplyr][] 'verbs' can be piped together

- `tibble()` -- representation of a `data.frame`, with better display
  of long and wide data frames. `tribble()` constructs a tibble in a
  way that makes the relationship between data across rows more
  transparent.
- `glimpse()` -- providing a quick look into the columns and data in
  the tibble by transposing the tibble and display each 'column' on a
  single line.
- `select()` -- column selection.
- `filter()`, `slice()` -- row selection.
- `pull()` -- extract a single column as a vector.
- `mutate()` -- column transformation.
- `count()` -- count occurences in one or more columns.
- `arrange()` -- order rows by values in one or more columns.
- `distinct()` -- reduce a tibble to only unique rows.
- `group_by()` -- perform computations on groups defined by one or
  several columns.
- `summarize()` -- calculate summary statstics for groups.
- `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()` -- merge two tibbles
  based on shared columns, preserving all rows in the first
  (`left_join()`) or second (`right_join()`) or both (`inner_join()`)
  tibble.

```{r}
tbl |>
    ## e.g., just rows with non-negative values of x and y
    filter(x > 0, y > 0) |>
    ## add a column
    mutate(distance_from_origin = sqrt(x^2 + y^2))
```

A 'classic' built-in data set -- Motor Trend 'cars' from
1974... 'tidyverse' eschews rownames, so make these a column. Use
`group_by()` to summarize by group (`cyl`). `n()` is a function from
dplyr that returns the number of records in a group.

```{r}
mtcars_tbl <-
    mtcars |>
    as_tibble(rownames = "model") |>
    mutate(cyl = factor(cyl))
mtcars_tbl

mtcars_tbl |>
    group_by(cyl) |>
    summarize(
        n = n(),
        mean_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
        var_mpg = var(mpg, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

## Visualization

Let's return to a basic tibble

```{r}
tbl <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(100),
    y = x + rnorm(100)
)
```

Use the contributed package [ggplot2][] for visualization.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(tbl) +
    aes(x, y) +                # use 'x' and 'y' columns for plotting...
    geom_point() +             # ...plot points...
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") # ...linear regresion
```

Check out [plotly][], especially for interactive visualization (e.g.,
'tooltips' when mousing over points, or dragging to subset and zoom
in)

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
plt <-
    ggplot(mtcars_tbl) +
    aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, text = model) +
    geom_jitter(width = .25) +
    geom_boxplot()
ggplotly(plt)
```

## Where do Packages Come From?

- [CRAN][]: *C*omprehensive *R* *A*rchive *N*etwork. More than 18,000
  packages. Some help from [CRAN Task Views][] in identifying relevant
  packages.

- [Bioconductor][]: More than 2100 packages relevant to
  high-throughput genomic analysis. _Vignettes_ are an important part
  of _Bioconductor_ packages.

Install packages once per _R_ installation, using
`BiocManager::install(<package-name>)` (CRAN or Bioconductor)

What about GitHub? Packages haven't been checked by a formal system,
so may have incomplete code, documentation, dependencies on other
packages, etc. Authors may not yet be committed to long-term
maintenance of their package.

# Survival analysis

These notes are from [Survival Analysis with R][SAR]

## Basic Kaplan-Meier analysis

```{r}
library(survival)  # base R package for survival analysis
library(dplyr)     # data representation
library(ggplot2)   # pretty pictures
library(ggfortify) # 'autoplot'
```

## An example dataset

We use data derived from the built-in 'veterans' dataset from the
'Veterans' Administration Lung Cancer study'; see `?veterans` for
details.

```{r}
## use `file.choose()` or similar for your own data sets
veteran_csv <- system.file(package = "ArtNET2023", "extdata/veteran.csv")
veteran <- readr::read_csv(veteran_csv)
veteran
```

Columns in the datasset are described as:

- trt: 1=standard, 2=test
- celltype: squamous, smallcell, adeno, large
- time: survival time (months?)
- status: censoring status
- karno: Karnofsky performance score (100=good)
- diagtime: months from diagnosis to randomisation
- age: in years
- prior: prior therapy 0=no, 10=yes

Some of the covariate can be summarized using 'tidy' functions, e.g.,

```{r}
veteran |>
    count(celltype, trt) |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = trt, values_from = n)
```

For continuous variables like `age`, it may be useful to stratify the
data, e.g., separating individuals as less than 60 (`LT60`), or
greater than or equal to 60 (`GE60`). For `trt`, the encoding is a
`double`, but it makes more sense for this to be a categorical
variable

```{r}
veteran <-
    veteran |>
    mutate(
        age_group = factor(ifelse((age < 60), "LT60", "GE60")),
        trt = factor(trt, labels = c("control", "treatment"))
    )
```

The `celltype` and `trt` summary table is more informative

```{r}
veteran |>
    count(celltype, trt) |>
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = trt, values_from = n)
```

## Kaplan-Meier curve for the entire data

Fit a standard survival model to the entire dataset

```{r}
km <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, veteran)
```

It is useful to know the 'class' of `km`

```{r}
class(km)
```

And to get a summary of the data after different lengths of time...

```{r}
summary(km, times = c(1, 30, 60, 90, 180, 360, 720))
```

... but nothing communicates like a figure (for help with the
`autoplot` function applied to `survfit` object, see
`?autoplot.survfit`).

```{r}
autoplot(km)
```

## Kaplan-Meier curve stratified by treatment or age group

It is easy to fit Kaplan-Meier curves to groups, e.g,. treatment

```{r}
km_trt <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ trt, data=veteran)
autoplot(km_trt)
```

```{r}
km_age <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ age_group, veteran)
autoplot(km_age)
```

## Cox proportional hazards model

Kaplan-Meier plots are useful for visualization, but is there
statistical support for an effect of treatment? Use the Cox
proportional hazards model as a basis for statical understand. In the
summary table, `trttest` indicates that the summary reports the effect
of `test` compared to `standard` as the base line.

```{r}
cox <- coxph(
    Surv(time, status) ~ trt,
    data = veteran
)
summary(cox)
```

It is straight-forward to test more complicated models, e.g., whether
`age` is a statistically meaningful contribution to survival, although
interpretation even of this 'simple' model should probably be
discussed with a statistician.

```{r}
cox <- coxph(
    Surv(time, status) ~ age + trt,
    data = veteran
)
summary(cox)
```
